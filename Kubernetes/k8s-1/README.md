Common kubectl Commands
=======================

Namespaces
Kubernetes uses namespaces to organize objects in the cluster. You can think of each
namespace as a folder that holds a set of objects. By default, the kubectl command-
line tool interacts with the default namespace. If you want to use a different
namespace, you can pass kubectl the --namespace flag. For example, kubectl --
namespace=mystuff references objects in the mystuff namespace.

Contexts

    If you want to change the default namespace more permanently, you can use a
    context. This gets recorded in a kubectl configuration file, usually located at
    $HOME/.kube/config. This configuration file also stores how to both find and
    authenticate to your cluster. For example, you can create a context with a different
    default namespace for your kubectl commands using:

        microk8s.kubectl config set-context my-context --namespace=mystuff

    This creates a new context, but it doesn’t actually start using it yet. To use this newly
    created context, you can run:

        microk8s.kubectl config use-context my-context

Viewing Kubernetes API Objects

    Everything contained in Kubernetes is represented by a RESTful resource.
    Throughout this book, we refer to these resources as Kubernetes objects. Each
    Kubernetes object exists at a unique HTTP path; for example, https://your-
    k8s.com/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/my-pod leads to the representation of a pod
    in the default namespace named my-pod. The kubectl command makes HTTP
    requests to these URLs to access the Kubernetes objects that reside at these paths.

    The most basic command for viewing Kubernetes objects via kubectl is get. If you
    run kubectl get <resource-name> you will get a listing of all resources in the
    current namespace. If you want to get a specific resource, you can use kubectl get
    <resource-name> <object-name>.

    By default, kubectl uses a human-readable printer for viewing the responses from
    the API server, but this human-readable printer removes many of the details of the
    objects to fit each object on one terminal line. One way to get slightly more
    information is to add the -o wide flag, which gives more details, on a longer line. If
    you want to view the complete object, you can also view the objects as raw JSON or
    YAML using the -o json or -o yaml flags, respectively.

    A common option for manipulating the output of kubectl is to remove the headers,
    which is often useful when combining kubectl with Unix pipes (e.g., kubectl ... |
    awk ...). If you specify the --no-headers flag, kubectl will skip the headers at the
    top of the human-readable table.

    Another common task is extracting specific fields from the object. kubectl uses the
    JSONPath query language to select fields in the returned object. The complete
    details of JSONPath are beyond the scope of this chapter, but as an example, this
    command will extract and print the IP address of the pod:

        microk8s.kubectl get pods my-pod -o jsonpath --template={.status.podIP}


Creating, Updating, and Destroying Kubernetes
    Objects
    Objects in the Kubernetes API are represented as JSON or YAML files. These files
    are either returned by the server in response to a query or posted to the server as part
    of an API request. You can use these YAML or JSON files to create, update, or
    delete objects on the Kubernetes server.

    Let’s assume that you have a simple object stored in obj.yaml. You can use kubectl
    to create this object in Kubernetes by running:

        microk8s.kubectl apply -f obj.yaml

    Notice that you don’t need to specify the resource type of the object; it’s obtained
    from the object file itself.
    Similarly, after you make changes to the object, you can use the apply command
    again to update the object:

        microk8s.kubectl apply -f obj.yaml

    Interactive edit :

        microk8s.kubectl edit <resource-name> <obj-name>

    Delete :

            microk8s.kubectl delete -f obj.yaml

        But it is important to note that kubectl will not prompt you to confirm the delete.
        Once you issue the command, the object will be deleted.
        Likewise, you can delete an object using the resource type and name:

            microk8s.kubectl delete <resource-name> <obj-name>

    Labeling :

            microk8s.kubectl label pods bar color=red

        By default, label and annotate will not let you overwrite an existing label. To do
        this, you need to add the --overwrite flag.
        If you want to remove a label, you can use the -<label-name> syntax:

            microk8s.kubectl label pods bar -color
    
    Debugging Commands :

        microk8s.kubectl logs <pod-name>

        microk8s.kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- bash

        microk8s.kubectl cp <pod-name>:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/file


        microk8s.kubectl help
            or:
        microk8s.kubectl help command-name
